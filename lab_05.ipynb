    "# APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems only natural that we should be able to extract any data from the internet by programmatically logging information after \"going\" to each website you're interested in. (In fact, it is [perfectly legal](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/04-Data-Collection/01-User-Ethics-Legal-Concerns.html).) One way to do this is using [web scraping](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/04-Data-Collection/02-Web-Scraping-Part1.html), where you write an algorithm which parses website content, logs data, and loops through several HTML web pages. But, this method is becoming less effective over the years, as websites are becoming far more complex (harder to scrape), and most companies are transitioning to a platform where their data is more easily accessible (and controlled) in an Application Programming Interface (API).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "**An API allows you to programmatically extract and interact with company data which drives their websites.** In this way, social networks, museums, foundations, research labs, applications, and projects can make their data publicly available, allowing for developers to use the data to build applications and tools (e.g., for your phone, computer, or refrigerator) that can be used by the general populous. For example, the reason you can access Google Maps on your phone is because developers used the Google Maps API to build that functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there are plenty of companies or foundations which will likely never use APIs to store/access their data. In these cases though, you can usually find an API that is *related* to that website, or someone may have built (or, they are building) a third-party API for that purpose. Web scraping should typically be a last resort, so we do not teach it in this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**Caveat:** People typically design their APIs such that they decide exactly which kinds of data they want to share. So, they often choose not to share their most lucrative and desirable data. In those cases, you are usually asked to pay some fee.</span>"

    "## Using Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss environment variables more in a future lesson, but to use APIs properly, we need to have at least a basic understanding of what environment variables are.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working on any data science project (e.g., like the web app you'll build later in this course), you will likely track your progress using Git/GitHub. But, keys and secret strings (like the ones we will use to access an API) should never be pushed to GitHub. Instead, it's a best practice to use environment variables when dealing with this kind of data. In short, environment variables are values stored in a special file on your local computer, or on the cloud where your project may be hosted. In this way, those variables are only accessible to agents with access to that file (e.g., your Python interpreter, or the one on the cloud).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, we will use [dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv#getting-started) to manage environment variables for API. You'll need to `pip` install it, as directed in the instructions, then create a file with the name *.env* (notice the period) in your project directory to hold any keys or secrets. Since we're going to use this package in this notebook, we'll import the library here. *Note: If you're using Git/GitHub, make sure \".env\" is added to your [.gitignore file](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore)*."

    "The steps to access *any* API are about the same, no matter the API. So, in this lesson, we're going to use the [Genius](https://genius.com/) API to access data about songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Client Access Token\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, to use an API, you need a special API key usually called a \"Client Access Token\", which is kind of like a password. Many APIs require authentication keys to gain access to them. To get your necessary Genius API keys, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the [api-clients page](https://genius.com/api-clients) (which will prompt you to [sign up for an account](https://genius.com/signup_or_login) if you haven't already). Then, click the button that says **\"New API Client\"**.\n",
    "2. Remember, APIs are expecting *developers* to use their APIs to build applications (e.g., for your phone, computers, etc.). But, since we're only doing data analysis for a college course in informatics, we only need to fill in the fields for \"App Name\" (e.g., *\"Song Lyrics Project\"*), and \"App Website URL\" (e.g., *\"https://github.com/leontoddjohnson/i501\"*). Then, click **Save**.\n",
    "3. When you click \"Save,\" you'll be given a series of API Keys: a \"Client ID\" and a \"Client Secret.\" **Copy/Paste these values into your *.env* file** without quotations, as instructed in the dotenv documentation. For example, my *.env* file looks something like this:\n",
    "    CLIENT_ID=asdfghjkl;123456789\n",
    "    CLIENT_SECRET=qwertyuiop098765432\n",
    "6. To generate your \"Client Access Token,\" which is the API key that we'll be using in this notebook, you need to click \"Generate Access Token\". Place that in your *.env* file as you did the other variables, maybe under the variable name ACCESS_TOKEN.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can access our `ACCESS_TOKEN` by using *dotenv* to load our environment variables into the current environment, then with the built-in Python *os* library to access it."

It is easily the most popular language for accessing large tabular databases, so naturally, many companies and users have used the language to create their own variants of the language called [dialects](https://arctype.com/blog/sql-dialects/). In this class, we will be using [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) and its corresponding dialect.\n",
